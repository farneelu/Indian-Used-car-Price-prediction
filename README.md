## Introduction

This project aims to predict the prices of used cars in India based on various features such as make, model, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It contains information about used cars sold in India.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
git clone https://github.com/farneelu/Indian-Used-car-Price-prediction.git
cd Indian-Used-car-Price-prediction
python preprocess.py
python train.py

Results
The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score.
